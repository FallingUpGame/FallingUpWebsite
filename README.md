# Falling Up Website Assets

This repository contains assets for the future _Falling Up_ website. Included are `Icons`, `Images`, & `Screenshots` that may prove useful during implementation.

In the meantime, you can learn more about _Falling Up_ on the official __[Project Page](https://fallingupgame.github.io/FallingUp/)__.

## Future Development

The website will end up as an extension of [mediatedcultures.net](mediatedcultures.net). MediatedCultures is operated by the [K-State Anthropology Department](http://www.k-state.edu/sasw/anth/) under the direction of [Micheal Wesch](http://www.michaelwesch.com). It uses [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) for publishing, and will likely end up with a dedicated domain closer to release.

A prototype has already been created using the SquareSpace development platform:

### Image Optimization

Before publishing, hosted images should be optimized using a tool such as [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac). This reduces file size considerably without major sacrifices to image quality.
